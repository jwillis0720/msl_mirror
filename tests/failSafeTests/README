Fail safe tests for MSL can be of two types:

1) Comparison tests - compare with trunk
   - Example: total energy of a system, chain, position, residue is the same as before
        comparision_totalEnergy.cpp

2) Standalone tests - compare with self (hard-coded answers)
   - Example: generating new LEU residues creates and populates all the atoms properly
        standalone_createAminoAcids.cpp



As a first pass, the comparision tests will simply compare the stdout from
development MSL and the trunk MSL.  

The standalone tests will output "PASS" or "FAIL"

These tests will all create their own MSLOUT stream, the python script
then will grep only for the MSLOUT appropriate for that test.
